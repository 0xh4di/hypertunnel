# ✨  hypertunnel

> When localtunnel/ngrok is not enough.

This free TCP relay/reverse proxy service can be used to **expose any TCP/IP service** running behind a NAT. It's based on the excellent [node-tcp-relay](https://github.com/tewarid/node-tcp-relay) from [tewarid](https://github.com/tewarid), adding self-service multi-client support similar to localtunnel, a cool project name with "hyper" in it and **a free public server**.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g hypertunnel
```

## Usage

```bash
# If 8080 is the local TCP/IP service port you wish to expose on the internet
hypertunnel --port 8080
# > Tunneling hypertunnel.ga:64118 > localhost:8080
```


## Comparison to localtunnel/ngrok

Both are great services! 
If your use-case is to simply tunnel local http/https web server traffic I suggest using them. :-)

I ran into issues when trying to expose a local proxy server (to use the client as forwarding proxy). Both services need to inspect and rewrite HTTP headers for routing, so using the tunnel as a proxy in e.g. Chrome won't work. There are a couple other use-cases where raw TCP stream tunnelling is desired and hypertunnel is the only available option.

**Technical differences**

Instead of using hostnames to direct traffic to clients, hypertunnel is using **a dedicated public port per tunnel**. This greatly simplifies things as TCP/IP traffic can be routed based on the assigned port, without http header inspection and rewriting.


## Free server: hypertunnel.ga

I really like the simplicity of services like [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) & [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) as they're **generously offering a free server**.
I'm doing the same for hypertunnel but beware of using this free server in mission critical settings.
If you'd like to offer sponsorship for the public server feel cheered at and please raise a ticket. :-)

PS: You can also self-host a private [hypertunnel-server](/packages/hypertunnel-server) and point the [client](/packages/hypertunnel) to it.

**Limits**

There are currently no enforced usage limits, in the hopes that you will use the server in good faith.
Tunnels are destroyed when you exit the client and latest after 24 hours of creation.



## Status

It's doing what it says on the tin. Certain things could be improved and battle-hardened. It works for my current use-case so please raise an issue if you encounter problems.

The CLI interface is stable, but programmatic usage comes with no warranty as internals might change in the future (the internals are also not properly documented currently).

Have a look at the [tests](/test/) to get an idea of how to use hypertunnel programmatically.

Given that there is no alternative to hypertunnel I figured I'd rather release it early. :-)


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. 

We use a [monorepo](/) powered by [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#--use-workspaces) (and yarn workspaces), [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) for testing and the [standard](https://standardjs.com/) style for linting.

**Monorepo cheat sheet**

```bash
# Make sure you have a recent version of yarn & lerna installed:
npm install -g yarn lerna

# Bootstrap the packages in the current Lerna repo. 
# Installs all of their dependencies and links any cross-dependencies.
yarn bootstrap

# Install debug in all packages
lerna add debug

# Install debug in all packages as dev dependency
lerna add --dev debug

# Install fs-extra to hypertunnel-server
lerna add fs-extra --scope=hypertunnel-server

# Remove dependency
# https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/833
lerna exec -- yarn remove fs-extra

# Run test in all packages
yarn test
```


### Todo

**server & client**
- Hook into `node-tcp-relay` events for better cleanup, error reporting and to show established connections
- Support environment variables next to cli params

**server**
- Use e.g. redis or message passing for tunnel manager data to support clustering
- Battle-hardening (e.g. rate-limits to keep bad actors out) - don't make this a necessity please ಠ_ಠ
